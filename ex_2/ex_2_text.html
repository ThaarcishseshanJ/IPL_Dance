<mytag style="color:#724141ec;">The origins of dance in India go back into the ancient times. 
    The earliest paleolithic and neolithic cave paintings such as the UNESCO world heritage site at Bhimbetka rock shelters in Madhya Pradesh shows dance scenes.
    Several sculptures found at Indus Valley civilization archaeological sites, now distributed between Pakistan and India, show dance figures. 
    For example, the Dancing Girl sculpture is dated to about 2500 BCE, shows a 10.5 centimetres (4.1 in) high figurine in a dance pose</mytag>
